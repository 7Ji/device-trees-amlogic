# device-trees-amlogic
This repository contains Linux Kernel device tree files used in [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv) releases for Amlogic hardware. The dts files here must be compiled to dtb format for use. It is not possible to use/test them on SD cards or USB drives without compiling.

SoC families:

* Amlogic S905 = p200/p201
* Amlogic S905X = p212
* Amlogic S905D = p230/231
* Amlogic S912 = q200/q201
